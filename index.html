        <h2>Sentience</h2>
        <p class="meaning">
            Sentience is the capacity to experience feelings and sensations. The word was first coined by philosophers
            in the 1630s for the concept of an ability to feel, derived from Latin sentientem, to distinguish it from
            the ability to think. In modern Western philosophy, sentience is the ability to experience sensations.
